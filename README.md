# Snapsort Landing page: Desktop utility application for sorting

## Introduction

Welcome to the Snapsort landing page. Snapsort is a small and simple open source desktop application that lets you sort a folder of files by year and month. It's a project I've created primarily to meet my personal need to be able to sort and organize photos from any folder in two clicks. This site is a landing page presenting the project and allowing you to download it.
